# Relativistic Effects in Ultra-Large-Scale Clustering

``HorizonGRound`` is a Python package that offers tools for forward
modelling of general relativistic effects from tracer luminosity functions
as well as comparing relativistic corrections with the local primordial
non-Gaussianity signature in large-scale clustering statistics.


## Installation

The simplest installation method is ``pip``:

```bash
pip install horizonground
```
